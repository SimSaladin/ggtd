## Nice-to-have-things

- Integration possibilities with things like github issues
- More library-oriented design; user could build a customized instance of the
    program on top of the library.
- Toggleable filtering for done etc. in listing
- Fuzzy matching of nodes - unique substring match in nodes under view context?
- Timed nodes: specify remind-like flag for triggers which add an edge to the
    node from a tracking node
- Sorting by relevance
- Default connect new childs to some node that is used to track incoming things
- Find function
